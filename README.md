## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass

### What I learned

- I tried Sass with BEM design. It's kind of confusing in the begining, but I think it's good system expecially responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [Writing Cleaner CSS using BEM](https://israelmitolu.hashnode.dev/writing-cleaner-css-using-bem-methodology) - This helped me to capture the concept of BEM design.
